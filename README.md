# A List Of Mods Made To The Original files by Doesntfazer:

-A circular hole was created in the middle that can accomodate either a 25mm trackball powered by PMW3360 sensor.

-A Chinese "Bird" character was extruded or embross above the trackball in the center. I have also made a "Ironman" theme embross logo case but that case will not be public due to copyright issue. 
Only the "Bird" logo case will be released to the public.

-A Ironman ball holder cover was purchased from AE to cover the 25mm trackball when not in use to prevent the ball from falling off. No I haven't had the time to learn new skills as how to design the
trackball holder to have notches that latches to the ball. The Ironman cover is initially use for push start button for cars. You can also do a search on AE for it. I will not provide the link here.

-Base of the trackball holder with lens cut out is integrated into the top case with integrated 5mm switch plate. Top case sits flush with pcb.

-Additional 3 keys were added below the trackball for use as right click, scroll lock and left click.

-Full keyboard case was created to house the PCB.

-First time I have the hot swappable Kailh PCB being sponsored. As of Aug 30, 2024, the sponsored PCB is still being assembly. As always print the PCB at your own risk.

-Bird is powered by RP2040 Core - A which you can get from AE. I will not provide the link since I don't anything from the sellers at AE if I endorse it here. Do a search in AE.

-QMK code is borrowed from aki27 bally and modified the matrix to fit my Bird (no pun intended). No suppport will be given since I just copy and paste.

-Use M2 brass hot inserts 3.2mm diameter and 4mm length for the M2 screws to secure the case. I forgot how long is my M2 screws are but they should be greater than 10mm so estimated around 14.6mm. Play around with and buy multiple M2 lenght screws.
